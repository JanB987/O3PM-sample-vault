## Checklist
*Guide and checklist for installation of [[Car Seat 1]].*

- [ ] Position [[Car Seat 1]] on [[Chassis X1]]; align rails and holes.
- [ ] Insert [[Screw 1]], [[Screw 2]], [[Screw 3]] and [[Screw 4]] into designated screw holes. 
- [ ] Verify size, grade, length-specs of [[Screw 1]], [[Screw 2]], [[Screw 3]] and [[Screw 4]].
- [ ] **Pre-seat** all four screws by hand (‚â•3 full turns). Do **not** fully tighten yet.
- [ ] Square the seat (front/rear & left/right gaps).
- [ ] **Snug sequence:** tighten screws lightly in an X-pattern (1‚Üí3‚Üí2‚Üí4) so the seat settles evenly.
- [ ] **Final torque:** tighten screws in the same X-pattern to **[[Seat‚ÄìChassis Torque Spec]]**.
- [ ] Apply torque paint marks and record [[Operator]], [[Tool ID]], [[Torque Result Log]].
- [ ] Functional checks: slide fore/aft, latch both rails, verify rattle-free, confirm wiring/connectors (airbag/occupancy sensor) are secure.
