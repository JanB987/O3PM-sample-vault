## 👋 Welcome to the O3PM Sample Vault

Hi there, and welcome!

This vault is a hands-on introduction to **[Object-Oriented Project Management (O3PM)](https://nosy.science/2025/05/10/object-oriented-management-in-obsidian-o3pm/)** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). If you’ve ever felt like your notes, tasks, and ideas were drifting in different directions—this system brings them together.
This vault was created for curious minds who love structure *and* creativity. It will continually be expanded as I work through more use cases. 
You can read more about the method on [nosy.science](https://nosy.science/2025/05/10/object-oriented-management-in-obsidian-o3pm/).


## 🚦 How to Use This Vault

Start with:
1. [[Welcome]] – you’re already here!
2. [[O3PM Basics]] – for a short overview of the concept
Then browse at your own leasure.

## 💻 About O3PM
O3PM is a modular, object-based approach to managing projects. Instead of treating notes like pages in a notebook, we treat them like **objects** in a system: People, Tools, Locations, Deliverables, and more. These objects are linked, queried, and managed in context—so your entire vault becomes a dynamic, living system.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Inside

This vault includes:
- ✅ **Object notes** with metadata and backlinks  
- 🧩 **[[Templates]]** for creating consistent notes 
- 🧠 **[[Classes|Object class definitions]]** for clarity  
- 📊 **[[O3PM Use Cases|Use cases]]** powered by Dataview  
- 💻[[O3PM Basics]]
- 📁 A **[[PRJT - Sample Project|sample project]]** to show it in action  

Every part is lightweight and flexible. You can adapt the system to your own workflows or scale it into something massive.

## ✨ Outro

If you have ideas, questions, or want to show how you adapted this method, feel free to reach out or tag me in the Obsidian Discord or Reddit. Let’s keep building.
