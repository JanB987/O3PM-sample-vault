# Established Use Cases

## Task Management
### [[Use Case - GTD with the Object Responsibility Modul]]
Tasks multiply like the heads of a hydra, and most systems just log the chaos. In this article, I introduce the Object Responsibility Module (ORM), a lightweight framework within O3PM that turns every person, place, or system into a task-aware dashboard. By embedding natural language tasks and linking them to digital objects, this setup uses Obsidian’s Dataview plugin to create fast, contextual overviews of what needs to happen where, and by whom. No more chasing tasks across tools. Instead: clarity, connection, and control.

## Timelines

> A day without Gantt Charts is a lost day.

### [[Use Case - Manual Gantt Chart]]
As a project manager, keeping track of timelines is essential. With Obsidian and the Mermaid diagram syntax, you can manually create Gantt charts right inside your notes — no external tools required. This hands-on approach gives you full control over how your project timeline is visualized and keeps your planning embedded in your documentation.

### [[Use Case - Automatic Gantt Chart]]
Updating Gantt charts manually is time-consuming and error-prone — especially when stakeholders demand different versions. This article shows how to automate Gantt chart generation in Obsidian using DataviewJS and Mermaid. With dynamic metadata-driven timelines, project planning becomes easier, faster, and far more maintainable.

## Meetings

### [[Use Case - Meeting Preparation]]
Meetings are everywhere—and they cost more than we think.
In this article, we dive into how Object-Oriented Project Management (O3PM) in Obsidian can help you run better meetings with less effort. From smart metadata and linked agenda items to participant check-ins using the Object Responsibility Module (ORM), this guide shows how a simple setup can turn meetings into efficient, traceable checkpoints—instead of time sinks.
