## Description
This use case solves the pain of tasks scattered over countless objects within your vault. It connects objects to tasks through the use of the so called [[Object Responsibility Module]] or [[Object Responsibility Module|ORM]]. 
To learn more about the module and its use you can check out the Article [GTD in O3PM â€“ Managing actionable contexts through smart task queries in Obsidian](https://nosy.science/2025/06/03/gtd-in-o3pm-managing-actionable-contexts-through-smart-task-queries-in-obsidian/) on [Nosy.Science](https://nosy.science/).
